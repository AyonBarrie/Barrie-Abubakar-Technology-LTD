					<center><h2 class="heading">The new product development process in 6 steps</h2></center>
					
					<P class="Content">New product development is the process of bringing an original product idea to market. Although it differs by industry, it can essentially be broken down into five stages: ideation, research, planning, prototyping, sourcing, and costing.
					Here's how to develop your own original product idea and what to consider at each stage.
					</p>
					<P class="Content"><center><h2>Ideation</h2></center>
					Many aspiring entrepreneurs get stuck on ideation, often because they’re waiting for a stroke of genius to reveal the perfect product they should sell. While building something fundamentally "new" can be creatively fulfilling, many of the best ideas are the result of iterating upon on an existing product.
					The SCAMPER model is a useful tool for quickly coming up with product ideas by asking questions about existing products. Each letter stands for a prompt:
					<p>Substitute (e.g. fur in faux fur)</p>
					<p>Combine (e.g. a phone case and a battery pack)</p>
					<p>Adapt (e.g. a bra with front clasps for nursing)</p>
					<p>Modify (e.g. an electric toothbrush with a sleeker design)</p>
					<p>Put to another use (e.g. memory foam dog beds)</p>
					<p>Eliminate (e.g. the middleman to sell sunglasses and pass the savings on to consumers)</p>
					<p>Reverse/Rearrange (e.g. a duffle bag so that it doesn’t wrinkle your suits)</p>
					By asking these questions, you can come up with novel ways to transform existing ideas or even adapt them for a new target audience or problem.
					If you're still looking for your "aha!" moment, we also put together a list of sources for coming up with your own product ideas, from analyzing online marketplaces for inspiration to reinventing historical trends.
					<P class="Content"><center><h2>Research</h2></center>
					With your product idea in mind, you may feel inclined to leapfrog ahead to production, but that can become a misstep if you fail to validate your idea first.
					Product validation ensures you’re creating a product people will pay for and that you won’t waste time, money, and effort on an idea that won't sell. There are several ways you can validate your product ideas, including:
					<p>Talking about your idea with family and friends</p>
					<p>Sending out an online survey to get feedback</p>
					<p>Starting a crowdfunding campaign</p>
					<p>Asking for feedback on forums like Reddit</p>
					<p>Researching online demand using Google Trends</p>
					<p>Launching a “coming soon” page to gauge interest via email opt-ins or pre-orders</p>
					However you decide to go about validating your idea, it is important to get feedback from a substantial and unbiased audience as to whether they would buy your product. Be wary of overvaluing feedback from people who “definitely would buy” if you were to create your theoretical product—until money changes hands, you can’t count someone as a customer.
					Validation research will also inevitably involve competitive analysis. If your idea or niche has the potential to take off, there are likely competitors already operating in that space.
					Visiting your competitors’ website and signing up for their email list will allow you to understand how they attract customers and make sales. Asking your own potential customers what they like or dislike about your competitors will also be important in defining your own competitive advantage.
					The information compiled from doing product validation and market research will allow you to gauge the demand for your product and also the level of competition that exists before you start planning.
					<P class="Content"><center><h2>Planning</h2></center>
					Since product development can quickly become complicated, it’s important to take the time to plan before you begin to build your prototype.
					When you eventually approach manufacturers or start looking for materials, if you don’t have a concrete idea of what you want your product to look like and how it will function, it’s easy to get lost in the subsequent steps.
					The best place to begin planning is with a hand-drawn sketch of what your product will look like. The sketch should be as detailed as possible, with labels explaining the various features and functions. You don't need a professional quality drawing since you won’t be submitting it to a manufacturer at this stage. However, if you are not confident that you can produce a legible diagram that will make sense of your product, it is easy to find illustrators for hire on Dribbble, UpWork, or Minty.
					Try to use your diagram to create a list of the different components or materials you will need in order to bring the product to life. The list does not need to be inclusive of all potential components, but it should allow you to begin planning what you will need in order to create the product.</p>

					<P class="Content"><center><h2>ProtoTyping</h2></center>
					The goal of the prototyping phase during product development is to create a finished product to use as a sample for mass production.
					It’s unlikely you will get to your finished product in a single attempt—prototyping usually involves experimenting with several versions of your product, slowly eliminating options and making improvements until you feel satisfied with a final sample. Prototyping also differs significantly depending on the type of product you are developing. The least expensive and simplest cases are products you can prototype yourself, such as food recipes and some cosmetic products. This do-it-yourself prototyping can also extend to fashion, pottery, design and other verticals, if you are lucky enough to be trained in these disciplines.
					However, more often than not, entrepreneurs will work with a third party to prototype their product. In the fashion and apparel industry, this usually involves working with a local seamstress (for clothing and accessories), cobbler (for shoes) or pattern maker (for clothing). These services can usually be found online by Googling local services in the industry.</P>
					<p>Most large cities also have art, design or fashion schools where students are trained in these techniques. Administrators from these university or college programs can usually grant you access to their internal job board where you can create a request for prototyping help.
					For objects like toys, household accessories, electronics, and many other hard-exterior objects, you may require a 3D rendering in order to make a prototype. Artists or engineers who are trained in computer-aided design and drafting (CAD) software can be contracted to do this, using UpWork or Freelancer. There are also user-friendly online tools such as SketchUp, TinkerCad and Vectary, for founders who want to learn how to create 3D models for themselves.</p>


					<P class="Content"><center><h2>Sourcing</h2></center>
					Once you have a product prototype you’re satisfied with, it is time to start gathering the materials and securing the partners needed for production. This is also referred to as building your supply chain: the vendors, activities, and resources that are needed to create a product and get it into a customers’ hands.
					While this phase will mainly involve looking for manufacturing-related services, you may also factor in storage, shipping, and warehousing into your choices at this stage.
					In Shoe Dog, a memoir by Nike founder Phil Knight, the importance of diversifying your supply chain is a theme that is emphasized throughout the story. Finding multiple suppliers for the different materials you will need, as well as different potential manufacturers, will allow you to compare costs. It also has an added benefit of creating a backup option if one of your suppliers or manufacturers doesn’t work out. Sourcing several options is an important part of safeguarding your business for the long-term.
					When looking for suppliers, there are plenty of resources both online and in person. While it may seem old-fashioned, many business owners choose to attend trade shows dedicated to sourcing. Trade shows like Magic in Las Vegas, provide the opportunity to see hundreds of vendors at once—to see, touch, and discuss materials and build a personal relationship with suppliers, which can be valuable when it comes time to negotiate prices.</P>

					<P class="Content"><center><h2>Costing</h2></center>
					After research, planning, prototyping, and sourcing is done, you should have a clearer picture of what it will cost to produce your product. Costing is the process of taking all of the information gathered thus far, and adding up what your cost of goods sold (COGS) will be, so that you can determine a retail price and gross margin.
					Begin by creating a spreadsheet with each additional cost broken out as a separate line item. This should include all of your raw materials, factory set up costs, manufacturing costs, and shipping costs. It is important to factor in shipping, import fees, and any duties you will need to pay in order to get your final product into the customers hands, as these fees can have a significant impact on your COGS depending on where you are producing the product.</P>
